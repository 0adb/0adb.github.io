<p class="subtitle"><strong>2022-05-22</strong></p>
<p>This is my first blog post. This is primarily a placeholder while I work on actual content, but I'll take the time here to declare my intent for these blogs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I'd like them to be semi-professional, or at least to be comfortable sharing these blogs with, say, a prospective recruiter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'd like these to skew a bit technical in focus. Specifically my initial idea for these blogs is to write code for fun, then, if I feel like it, talk about it on these blogs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all I've come up with currently. Here's to hoping that this isn't my last post. </p>
<hr />
<p>Subtitle is a reference to a book title that I enjoy, called  <em>Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret</em>, by Judy Blume. I haven't read the book, but I find the title neat. </p>
